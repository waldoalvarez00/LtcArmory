(NOTE:  This is for Linux only, I have not tried it on Windows)

This directory is for GoogleTest testing files.  At the time of this writing,
there is only one source:  CppBlockUtilsTest.cpp.  The Makefile expects to 
see GoogleTest version 1.6 unloaded three levels down and renamed as relative
to this directory:

   ../../../googletest

In other words, this Makefile expects to find the gtest Makefile in: 

   ../../../googletest/Makefile

This was implemented and used on Ubuntu 12.10.
